### About

this is a sandbox for me to test pulling data from a .js file and 
get it into local storage and out of local storage, and populate it withini a main container on the DOM 

- [x] encode data into json objects
- [x] store data to local storage
- [x] pull data from local storage
  - [ ] refine the way data is pulled
- [x] append data to page container
  - [ ] refine the way data is appended
