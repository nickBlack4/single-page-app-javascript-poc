## About

### Updated about 11/1/19
I was running through repos cleaning things up when I saw this.  I used this as an example to convince some team members when I was at NSS that we could load a single page 'app' this way.  We were working on a collaborative project and rather than us all manipulating multiple html files and trying to string them together with different css, etc. I thought we should just have a container on the main page.  In this container we could load each other's data based on the navigation link you clicked.  We ended up doing it this way and I saved this for reference in the future.

this is a sandbox for me to test pulling data from a .js file and 
get it into local storage and out of local storage, and populate it within a main container on the DOM 

- [x] encode data into json objects
- [x] store data to local storage
- [x] pull data from local storage
  - [ ] refine the way data is pulled
- [x] append data to page container
  - [ ] refine the way data is appended
